# FairlyRandomSelector

Fairly Random Selector

Generate random, same and fair selection on several computers. 

### Goal

0. Several computers run the selector to get the same random number *x*, asynchronous in different place, not influenced by any computer, even if the program is modified. 
1. Generate a random number *x ~ Uniform(a, b)*, where *a* and *b* is pre-appoint. 
Number *x* subjecting to uniform distribution is guaranteed by python Random module. 
2.
